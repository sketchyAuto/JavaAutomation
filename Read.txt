When the Armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak-hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak-hearted wither and moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
Hey, the victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self-defeat is your own dispute
And, man, you put yourself in your own shoes
Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
'Cause you're starring in your own movie
Playing of the role you choose, so
Stand up and fight if you know that you're right and know you will never fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail and the boat shall forever sail
Hey, there ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Hold down all the sprinklers on Mt. Olympus
My god's tougher than Zeus
